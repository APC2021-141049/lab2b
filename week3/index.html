Bocchi is literally me. No other character can come close to relating to me like her.<br>

There is no way you can convince me that I’m not Bocchi. Bocchi could not possibly be any more me.<br>

It’s me, and nobody can convince me otherwise. If anyone approached me about this not possibly being me, I immediately shut them down with overwhelming evidence that Bocchi was me.<br>
